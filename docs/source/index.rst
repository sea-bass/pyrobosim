Vision Statement
----------------

The vision for PyRoboSim is that you will be able to **create worlds** to prototype your robot behavior in a simple environment before moving to a more realistic simulator, or even real robot hardware.

To enable this, a typical user of PyRoboSim would:

* **Build complex worlds** using the world modeling framework, both manually and programmatically.
* **Define custom actions and action executors** (e.g., path planning/following or decision-making algorithms).
* **Design task and motion planners** that go from task specification to an executable plan.
* **Export worlds to Gazebo** to test in a 3D world with more complex sensing and actuation models.
