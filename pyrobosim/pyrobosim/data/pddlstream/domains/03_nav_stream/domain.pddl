; PDDL PLANNING DOMAIN (NAVIGATION STREAMS)
;
; This planning domain contains `navigate`, `pick`, and `place` actions.
;
; The `navigate` action uses streams to sample two sets of parameters:
; 1. A goal pose for a location is sampled from a discrete list of navigation poses,
;    denoted with the verified predicate `NavPose`.
; 2. A path from a motion planner is sampled from a motion planner,
;    denoted with the verified predicate `Motion`.
;
; Accompanying streams are defined in the `stream.pddl` file.
