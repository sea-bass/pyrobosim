; PDDL PLANNING DOMAIN (DERIVED PREDICATES)
;
; This planning domain contains `navigate`, `pick`, and `place` actions.
;
; All actions are symbolic, meaning there are no different types of grasps
; or feasibility checks, under the assumption that a downstream planner exists.
;
; This domain introduces the derived predicates `Has`, `HasNone`, and `HasAll`,
; which allow for more complex goal specifications.
;
; Accompanying streams are defined in the `stream.pddl` file.
